# Machine Learning Visualization
Visualization of ML algorithms using Jupyter-lab.

## Updates
### Project Update
__K-Nearest Neighbors__ demo is out.:tada:  
Next stop, __Perceptron__. :muscle:

### KNN Updates
Code comments will be available soon.

## Dependent Packages
- ipywidget
- ipympl Perferably install this via __jupyter__ not _pip_
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- scipy
- numpy

## Contribute
I need your help. 
### Help me to debug the codes
Play around with code and find bugs. You will definetly find one. When you do, open an issue or notify me via [this](ark.blackhat@gmail.com) email adress.  
Or if you are a developer, fix the bug and request a pull on github.
### Write the docs with me
As you know, the documentation of something is a crucial part of a project. A never-ending task. So, if you can help me write better docs, or even edit the existing ones, I'd appreciate it.
### Get to codeing
If you are a developer and wish to help with this project, there are several other algorithms that we can built demos for. A short list is available bellow (feel free to edit it). Pick an algorithm and get to work.
- Perceptron
- SVM
- K-Means
- SVM-Kernel
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forset
- Decision Tree
